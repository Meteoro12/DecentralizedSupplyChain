The DecentralizedSupplyChain project aims to revolutionize how supply chain data is managed, stored, and shared across various stakeholders. By leveraging blockchain technology, this project ensures immutable record-keeping, enhances transparency, and improves the overall security of supply chain operations. This repository contains the frontend JavaScript logic that enables interactive user interfaces for product and shipment entries, visualizes product statuses, seamlessly fetches data from the blockchain backend, and incorporates user authentication mechanisms. It is designed to work seamlessly with our decentralized backend, providing users with a real-time, secure, and transparent view of the supply chain process.
